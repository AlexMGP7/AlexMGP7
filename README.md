### Hi there 👋
### 🚀 About Me

🎓 I'm Alexander Gonzalez. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at Universidad de Oriente, and I expect to graduate in mid-2025.

👨‍💻 I'm proficient in various programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Java, C/C++, and Rust.

🎵 Besides my love for technology, I'm also a Salsa Casino teacher, and I enjoy dancing Salsa and Bachata in my free time.

🌐 Currently, I'm focusing on mastering web design and JavaScript. I'm also planning to delve into cybersecurity, and I'm excited to start learning it through freecodecamp.

✈️ Although I haven't had the opportunity to travel outside of Venezuela yet, I've explored different parts of my country, including Anzoategui and La Guaira.

If you have any more questions or if there's anything else you'd like to know, feel free to ask!
